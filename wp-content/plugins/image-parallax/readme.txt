Create images with a parallax effect. Upload some layers, configure the animation, and publish !

== Description ==

Upload the layers of your image, and create a parallax effect !

It works great on smart devices too !

The first step is to create with your favorite picture editing software (*Photoshop*, *GIMP*...) an independent image for each ground composing your image. All these layers shall be the **same size**, and should be in **.png** format as they are meant to include transparency areas.
Then, on your post editing page in WordPress, click the *Insert Media* button, and (the same way you would create a gallery) upload your layers under the *Create Parallax* item. Reorganise the layers if needed, from the background to the front.
You can finally configure the animation (calibrate, invert, limit, scalar, friction), and publish !

There is [some examples](http://webmaestro.fr/image-parallax-plugin-wordpress/) on the plugin page.

It uses [parallax.js](http://wagerfield.github.io/parallax/) by Matthew Wagerfield.

1. Upload `image-parallax` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Create a .png file for each layer
3. Create an effect, upload your layers, and publish !
